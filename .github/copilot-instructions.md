# Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game in Go with a focus on clean code and test-driven development.

## Coding Style

- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Follow Go's idiomatic practices, such as using `fmt.Sprintf` for string formatting.
- Avoid comments at all times unless absolutely necessary, as the code should be self-explanatory.
